The chatbot simulates AI responses intelligently - try asking about Python code, workout plans, startup ideas, or quantum computing to see the detailed responses. For other topics, it provides a thoughtful fallback response asking for clarification.
You can integrate this with a real backend API by replacing the generateResponse() function with an actual API call to OpenAI, Claude, or your preferred AI service.
